 # Key Takeaway from Project
 This project helped me hone my SQL querying skills for database retrieval and Manipulation.  
 I have been able to add to my toolkit the following SQL superpowers:
 - **CTEs and Subqueries**: I mastered the are of using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and subqueries, which helped me enhance the clarity and efficiency of my SQL queries. By leveraging CTEs, I was able to organize complex logic into more manageable parts, making my analysis easier to understand. The ability to embed subqueries also allowed me to perform sophisticated data retrievals seamlessly, resulting in more insightful outcomes from the datasets I worked with. üêê
 - **Data Aggregation Functions**: During this project, I deepened my understanding of data aggregation functions, which are essential for summarizing and analyzing information effectively. By applying functions like COUNT, AVG, and SUM, using Groupby statements, I was able to distill large volumes of data into meaningful metrics that highlighted key trends. This skill not only streamlined my analysis but also empowered me to present clearer insights that inform decision-making. üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 - **Analytics Superpower**: I developed my "analytics superpower" by embracing advanced analytical techniques and tools on real life data. This experience allowed me to uncover deeper insights from the data, revealing patterns that were not immediately apparent and work on ways for effective story telling to non technical stakeholders. üí™


 # Conclusions
### Insights from the Analysis include:
 1. Analysis to question 1 highlights some of the top-paying roles for Data Analysts, showcasing the companies, specific job titles, and average annual salaries. The roles vary in specialization, with titles such as "Director of Analytics," "Principal Data Analyst," and more entry-level positions like "Data Analyst." Notably, positions at companies like Mantys, Meta, and AT&T offer some of the highest salaries, which aligns with the trend that high-level or niche data analytics roles, often requiring specialized expertise, tend to command higher pay.
Additionally, for data professionals looking to maximize earnings, this data suggests that pursuing advanced, director-level analytics roles or focusing on high-demand skills like marketing analysis or performance analysis could be beneficial.

 2. High paying jobs require advanced proficiency in SQL, Python and Tableau. High paying roles also require understanding of cetain Libraries like Pandas. This is beneficial for individuals looking to go into Analyst roles to understand the skills required to get in and progress along the career ladder.
 3. The analysis of skills and salaries reveals distinct differences between the global data and that of Estonia. Globally, SQL is the most sought-after skill, with 92,628 listings and an average salary of $96,435, followed closely by Python, which commands the highest average salary at $101,511.8. This indicates a strong correlation between skill demand and earning potential in various data-related fields.  
 In contrast, Estonia shows a smaller market with SQL again leading, but with a lower average salary of $88,160. The presence of niche skills like Looker and Go suggests a developing landscape.
 4. The data reveals a strong demand for specialized technical skills, with PySpark leading the way at an impressive average salary of $208,172. This highlights the premium placed on advanced data processing capabilities in the industry. Following closely are Bitbucket and Couchbase, with average salaries of $189,155 and $160,515, respectively. Such figures suggest that expertise in version control and database management is also highly valued in today‚Äôs tech landscape.  
 Moreover, skills like Pandas and Databricks show competitive average salaries of around $151,821 and $141,907, reflecting their integral role in data science and analytics. This analysis indicates that while niche skills can yield higher compensation, there remains significant earning potential for commonly utilized technologies, underlining the importance of both specialized and versatile skill sets in career development for Data Analysts.
