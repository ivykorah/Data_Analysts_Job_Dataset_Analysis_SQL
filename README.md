### 3. Most in-demand skills for Data Analysts:
- The objective here is to discover the skills most frequently required in job postings for data analysts. This analysis helps to reveal the most sought-after qualifications for anyone looking to stay competitive in the job market. The Query used to answer this question can be found [HERE](/Project_sql/3_top_demand_skills_DA.sql) and highlighted below.

```sql
select 
    skills as skill_name,
    count(skills) count_of_skill,
    round(avg(salary_year_avg),1) as salary_average
FROM
    job_postings_fact jf
INNER JOIN 
    skills_job_dim sj on sj.job_id = jf.job_id
INNER JOIN 
    skills_dim sd on sd.skill_id = sj.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY 
    sd.skills
ORDER BY 
    count_of_skill DESC
LIMIT 10;



--for Estonia
select 
    skills as skill_name,
    count(skills) count_of_skill,
    round(avg(salary_year_avg),1) as salary_average
FROM
    job_postings_fact jf
INNER JOIN 
    skills_job_dim sj on sj.job_id = jf.job_id
INNER JOIN 
    skills_dim sd on sd.skill_id = sj.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    search_location like '%Estonia%'
GROUP BY 
    sd.skills
ORDER BY 
    count_of_skill DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Query revealed that the most in-deman skills for Data analyst roles include SQL, Excel, Python, Tableau and PowerBI.

### 4. Top skills based on salary:
- This analysis focuses on understanding which skills correlate with higher salaries. It provides insight into which specific capabilities are valued more by employers, linking them to better compensation. The Query used to answer this question can be found [HERE](/Project_sql/4_top_paying_skills.sql) and highlighted below.

```sql
select 
    skills as skill_name,
    count(skills) count_of_skill,
    round(avg(salary_year_avg),0) as salary_average
FROM
    job_postings_fact jf
INNER JOIN 
    skills_job_dim sj on sj.job_id = jf.job_id
INNER JOIN 
    skills_dim sd on sd.skill_id = sj.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' and 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_work_from_home = true
GROUP BY 
    sd.skills
ORDER BY 
    salary_average DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

Analysis shows that there is large potential for Big Query (PySpark, Couchbase), ML skills (DataRobot, Jupyter), and python Libraries (Pandas, NumPy).  
Knowledge in development and deplyment tools has high potential for jobs (GitLab, Kubernetes, Airflow).  
Also Cloud computing is an essential skill for high opaying Data Analyst roles.

The idea is to identify skills that are both in demand and highly paid, making them the most strategic to learn for career advancement. The Query used to answer this question can be found [HERE](/Project_sql/5_optimal_skill.sql) and highlighted below.

```sql
SELECT
    skills_dim.skill_id,
    skills_dim.skills as skill_name,
    count(skills_dim.skills) as count_of_skill,
    round(avg(salary_year_avg),0) as salary_average
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN 
    skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id 
INNER JOIN 
    skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id 
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
    AND job_work_from_home = True
GROUP BY
